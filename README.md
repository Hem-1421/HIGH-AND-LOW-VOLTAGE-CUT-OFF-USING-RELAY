# HIGH-AND-LOW-VOLTAGE-CUT-OFF-USING-RELAY

In this project, implemented the logic for protective circuit for high and low voltage cut-off using relay in voltage stabilizer switches ON and OFF continuously. Usually voltage stabilizers are used in this type of applications to maintain constant AC voltage. The frequent energization or de-energization of relays leads to the shortening the life time of appliances and the stabilizer itself. Hence it is better to use this project in order to control the voltage regulation of the appliances instead of costly stabilizers.
